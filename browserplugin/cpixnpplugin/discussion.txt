About naming: 
-------------

- Example classess uses NP prefix
- ECom plugin interfaces uses EComBrowserPlugin
- The API is called NP (netscape plugin) plugin API. NP runtime is part of it 
- The environment where we are aiming is WebKit 
- Browser is main using WebKit
- So, of which of these (NP, WebKit or Browser) we are developing plugin for? 
  - NP apparently. The plugin should also work (not really) in other S60 NP 
    compatible environments (like the old abandoned browser, all thought it 
    didn't support npruntime)
- The classes used in the plugin should be differentiated from S60 side classes
  in some way. Currently it is done with NP 'prefix'. Inconsistently, it appears 
  - In front of names: CNPSearchDocument
  - And in the middle of names: CCPixNPSearchDocument
  -> TODO? Switch CCPixNPSearchDocument to CNPCPixSearchDocument
 

About design:
-------------

- Are the inc/idl classes meant to allow direct usage of the objects e.g. 
  from other modules. If this is the case, are they allowed to expose 
  S60 interfaces (with descriptors etc.), or should they expose some 
  standard POSIX interfaces instead.
